# Warning this is an example code for answering a phpxpert question

File a.php includes file b.php 

and file b.php includes c.php 

and c.php includes d.php. 

All the files contains code of its own. 

Now is their any way to see all the that code in a single file? The final code parsed in code of all the files.
